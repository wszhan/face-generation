Face Generation

![CelebA](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/celeba/intro.png)

This project is to construct a [Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434) for [CelebA images](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html) data generation. It also comes with a DCGAN for [MNIST images](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) data generation.

For the convenience of your time, please run the project on GPU with TensorFlow-GPU. This project is run on AWS EC2 Ubuntu instance. To set up your environment on AWS with TensorFlow-GPU, please check [this post](https://wszhan.github.io/2018/04/09/udacity-dlnd-p3.html).
